## About Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

This year, Pulumi is participating in Hacktoberfest with three areas where the community at large can collaborate to build new open source capabilities.

### Native Pulumi Providers

Want Pulumi to work better with your favorite cloud services? We'll show you how to get started building providers that let Pulumi users take full advantage of these services.

### Operator and Automation API

Learn how to use Pulumi's new Kubernetes Superpowers to build truly automated deployments for your workloads.

### Reusable Infrastructure Libraries

One of Pulumi's superpowers is that it allows you to easily create new abstractions and infrastructure building blocks. In fact,
some of our own libraries like [awsx](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-awsx) and [kx](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-kubernetesx) 
do just that by creating higher-level components (i.e. [component resources](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#components)) 
on top of the [pulumi-aws](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws) and [pulumi-kubernetes](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-kubernetes) providers respectively. 

Here are some helpful links to get you started on authoring your own component resources:

* [Creating and Reusing Cloud Components using Package Managers](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/tutorials/aws/s3-folder-component/) - A step-by-step guide to building and publishing a `StaticWebsite` component.
* [AWS Lambda Warmer as Pulumi Component](https://mikhail.io/2018/08/aws-lambda-warmer-as-pulumi-component/) - An abstraction of a common pattern to avoid cold starts in AWS Lambda.
* [Pulumi Programming Model](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#components) - Documentation to understand the underlying concepts in a Pulumi program.
